# Sentiment-Prediction-of-Twitter-Feed-using-PEGASOS-and-AdaGrad
Data cleansing is performed on the tweets in the Sentiment140 dataset and a "bag of words" is obtained with their appropriate sentiment (positive or negative). Unigram features are extracted from the "bag of words" to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the PEGASOS Algorithm. With PEGASOS, the AdaGrad Algorithm is also used to train the SVM. The accuracy of the two methods is compared on the test dataset.
